@book{Kauffman1995,
abstract = {A major scientific revolution has begun, a new paradigm that rivalsDarwin's theory in importance. At its heart is the discovery of theorder that lies deep within the most complex of systems, from the originof life, to the workings of giant corporations, to the rise and fall ofgreat civilizations. And more than anyone else, this revolution is thework of one man, Stuart Kauffman, a MacArthur Fellow and visionarypioneer of the new science of complexity. Now, in At Home in theUniverse , Kauffman brilliantly weaves together the excitement ofintellectual discovery and a fertile mix of insights to give the generalreader a fascinating look at this new science-and at the forces fororder that lie at the edge of chaos.We all know of instances ofspontaneous order in nature-an oil droplet in water forms a sphere,snowflakes have a six-fold symmetry. What we are only now discovering,Kauffman says, is that the range of spontaneous order is enormouslygreater than we had supposed. Indeed, self-organization is a greatundiscovered principle of nature. But how does this spontaneous orderarise? Kauffman contends that complexity itself triggersself-organization, or what he calls "order for free," that if enoughdifferent molecules pass a certain threshold of complexity, they beginto self-organize into a new entity-a living cell. Kauffman uses theanalogy of a thousand buttons on a rug-join two buttons randomly withthread, then another two, and so on. At first, you have isolated pairs;later, small clusters; but suddenly at around the 500th repetition, aremarkable transformation occurs-much like the phase transition whenwater abruptly turns to ice-and the buttons link up in one giantnetwork. Likewise, life may have originated when the mix of differentmolecules in the primordial soup passed a certain level of complexityand self-organized into living entities (if so, then life is not ahighly improbable chance event, but almost inevitable). Kauffman usesthe basic insight of "order for free" to illuminate a staggering rangeof phenomena. We see how a single-celled embryo can grow to a highlycomplex organism with over two hundred different cell types. We learnhow the science of complexity extends Darwin's theory of evolution bynatural selection: that self-organization, selection, and chance are theengines of the biosphere. And we gain insights into biotechnology, thestunning magic of the new frontier of genetic engineering-generatingtrillions of novel molecules to find new drugs, vaccines, enzymes,biosensors, and more. Indeed, Kauffman shows that ecosystems, economicsystems, and even cultural systems may all evolve according to similargeneral laws, that tissues and terra cotta evolve in similar ways. Andfinally, there is a profoundly spiritual element to Kauffman's thought.If, as he argues, life were bound to arise, not as an incalculablyimprobable accident, but as an expected fulfillment of the naturalorder, then we truly are at home in the universe. Kauffman's earliervolume, The Origins of Order , written for specialists, received lavishpraise. Stephen Jay Gould called it "a landmark and a classic." AndNobel Laureate Philip Anderson wrote that "there are few people in thisworld who ever ask the right questions of science, and they are the oneswho affect its future most profoundly. Stuart Kauffman is one of these."In At Home in the Universe , this visionary thinker takes you along ashe explores new insights into the nature of life.},

The hypothesis that contemporary organisms are also randomly constructed molecular automata is examined by modeling the gene as a binary (on-off) device and studying the behavior of large, randomly constructed nets of these binary "genes". The results suggest that, if each "gene" is directly affected by two or three other "genes", then such random nets: behave with great order and stability; undergo behavior cycles whose length predicts cell replication time as a function of the number of genes per cell; possess different modes of behavior whose number per net predicts roughly the number of cell types in an organism as a function of its number of genes; and under the stimulus of noise are capable of differentiating directly from any mode of behavior to at most a few other modes of behavior. Cellular differentation is modeled as a Markov chain among the modes of behavior of a genetic net. The possibility of a general theory of metabolic behavior is suggested. {\textcopyright} 1969.},

Here we apply the idea of such parameterized synchrony to study the dynamics of the genetic regulatory network extracted from an artificial genome model. We find that the relationship between degree of synchrony and the number of limit cycles is not linear. The number and length of limit cycles peaks at intermediate values of s. The proportion of state space explored and the length of transient trajectories also follows this pattern. The richer behavior found at intermediate values of the synchrony parameter is much more characteristic of biological systems than either full synchrony or complete asynchrony.},

In comparison to most other mammals, humans have an expanded neocortex, with a pronounced increase in the number of cortical areas. This expansion underlies many complex behaviors associated with human capabilities including perception, cognition, language and volitional motor responses. In the following review we consider data from comparative studies as well as from developmental studies to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in arealization, and discuss how these mechanisms may have been modified in different lineages over time to produce the remarkable degree of organizational variability observed in the neocortex of mammals. Because any phenotype is a result of the complex interactions between genotypic influences and environmental factors, we also consider environmental, or epigenetic, contributions to the organization of the neocortex.},

abstract = {In this paper, we illustrate how dynamical systems theory can provide a unifying conceptual framework for evolution of biological regulatory systems. Our argument is that the genotype-phenotype map can be characterized by the phase portrait of the underlying regulatory process. The features of this portrait--such as attractors with associated basins and their bifurcations--define the regulatory and evolutionary potential of a system. We show how the geometric analysis of phase space connects Waddington's epigenetic landscape to recent computational approaches for the study of robustness and evolvability in network evolution. We discuss how the geometry of phase space determines the probability of possible phenotypic transitions. Finally, we demonstrate how the active, self-organizing role of the environment in phenotypic evolution can be understood in terms of dynamical systems concepts. This approach yields mechanistic explanations that go beyond insights based on the simulation of evolving regulatory networks alone. Its predictions can now be tested by studying specific, experimentally tractable regulatory systems using the tools of modern systems biology. A systematic exploration of such systems will enable us to understand better the nature and origin of the phenotypic variability, which provides the substrate for evolution by natural selection.},

In this paper, we present a theoretical model that explicitly considers the genetic factors and that is able to explain several sets of experiments on cortical area regulation involving transcription factors Emx2 and Pax6, and fibroblast growth factor FGF8. The model consists of the dynamics of thalamo-cortical connections modulated by signaling molecules that are regulated genetically, and by axonal competition for neocortical space. The model can make predictions and provides a basic mathematical framework for the early development of the thalamo-cortical connections and area patterning that can be further refined as more experimental facts become known.},

Physical traits, behaviors, and the extended phenotype are all selected features of an individual, but genes that covary with different aspects of the targets of selection are inherited. Here we review the variability in cortical organization, morphology, and behavior that have been observed across species and describe similar types of variability within species.We examine sources of variability and the constraints that limit the types of changes that evolution has and can produce.

abstract = {The neocortex is the part of the mammalian brain that is involved in perception, cognition, and volitional motor control. It is a highly dynamic structure that is dramatically altered within the lifetime of an animal and in different lineages throughout the course of evolution. These alterations account for the remarkable variations in behavior that species exhibit. Of particular interest is how these cortical phenotypes change within the lifetime of the individual and eventually evolve in species over time. Because we cannot study the evolution of the neocortex directly we use comparative analysis to appreciate the types of changes that have been made to the neocortex and the similarities that exist across taxa. Developmental studies inform us about how these phenotypic transitions may arise by alterations in developmental cascades or changes in the physical environment in which the brain develops. Both genes and the sensory environment contribute to aspects of the phenotype and similar features, such as the size of a cortical field, can be altered in a variety of ways. Although both genes and the laws of physics place constraints on the evolution of the neocortex, mammals have evolved a number of mechanisms that allow them to loosen these constraints and often alter the course of their own evolution.},

abstract = {The cerebral cortex is divided into many functionally distinct areas. The emergence of these areas during neural development is dependent on the expression patterns of several genes. Along the anterior-posterior axis, gradients of Fgf8, Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8 play a particularly strong role in specifying areal identity. However, our understanding of the regulatory interactions between these genes that lead to their confinement to particular spatial patterns is currently qualitative and incomplete. We therefore used a computational model of the interactions between these five genes to determine which interactions, and combinations of interactions, occur in networks that reproduce the anterior-posterior expression patterns observed experimentally. The model treats expression levels as Boolean, reflecting the qualitative nature of the expression data currently available. We simulated gene expression patterns created by all possible networks containing the five genes of interest. We found that only of these networks were able to reproduce the experimentally observed expression patterns. These networks all lacked certain interactions and combinations of interactions including auto-regulation and inductive loops. Many higher order combinations of interactions also never appeared in networks that satisfied our criteria for good performance. While there was remarkable diversity in the structure of the networks that perform well, an analysis of the probability of each interaction gave an indication of which interactions are most likely to be present in the gene network regulating cortical area development. We found that in general, repressive interactions are much more likely than inductive ones, but that mutually repressive loops are not critical for correct network functioning. Overall, our model illuminates the design principles of the gene network regulating cortical area development, and makes novel predictions that can be tested experimentally.},

abstract = {Computer models are valuable tools towards an understanding of the cell's biochemical regulatory machinery. Possible levels of description of such models range from modelling the underlying biochemical details to top-down approaches, using tools from the theory of complex networks. The latter, coarse-grained approach is taken where regulatory circuits are classified in graph-theoretical terms, with the elements of the regulatory networks being reduced to simply nodes and links, in order to obtain architectural information about the network. Further, considering dynamics on networks at such an abstract level seems rather unlikely to match dynamical regulatory activity of biological cells. Therefore, it came as a surprise when recently examples of discrete dynamical network models based on very simplistic dynamical elements emerged which in fact do match sequences of regulatory patterns of their biological counterparts. Here I will review such discrete dynamical network models, or Boolean networks, of biological regulatory networks. Further, we will take a look at such models extended with stochastic noise, which allow studying the role of network topology in providing robustness against noise. In the end, we will discuss the interesting question of why at all such simple models can describe aspects of biology despite their simplicity. Finally, prospects of Boolean models in exploratory dynamical models for biological circuits and their mutants will be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Royal Society.},

In the rodent somatosensory cortex, groups of neurons called "barrels" correspond to individual whiskers on the contralateral face. Barrels themselves often contain subbarrels organized into one of a few characteristic patterns. Here we demonstrate that similar patterns can be simulated by means of local growth-promoting and growth-retarding interactions within the circular domains of single barrels. The model correctly predicts that larger barrels contain more spatially complex subbarrel patterns, suggesting that the development of barrels and of the patterns within them may be understood in terms of some relatively simple dynamic processes. We also simulate the full nonlinear equations to demonstrate the predictive value of our linear analysis. Finally, we show that the pattern formation is robust with respect to the geometry of the barrel by simulating patterns on a realistically shaped barrel domain. This work shows how simple pattern forming mechanisms can explain neural wiring both qualitatively and quantitatively even in complex and irregular domains.},
